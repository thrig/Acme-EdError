=head1 NAME

Acme::EdError - implements ed(1) error handling

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Acme::EdError;

  warn "uh oh";
  die  "oh well";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements L<ed(1)> error handling in perl, eliminating
needless verbosity from warning and error messages. To quote the
L<ed(1)> manual:

  "When an error occurs, ed prints a `?' and either returns to command
  mode or exits if its input is from a script. An explanation of the
  last error can be printed with the `h' (help) command."

Help support has not yet been implemented in this module. (And likely
will not be.)
